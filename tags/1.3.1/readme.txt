== Installation ==
To install the plugin copy the <em>azurcurve-page-index</em> folder into your plug-in directory and activate it.

To use simply place the [page-index] shortcode on a page or in a post. Tiled page index based on child pages of the page the shortcode is used on.

If a different page index is required, or the shortcode is used in a post use one of the following parameters:
